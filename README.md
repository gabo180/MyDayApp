# MyDay Productivity App

MyDay is a web app focused on a dead simple UI/UX to focus on your daily tasks. Using the [priority matrix](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/priority-matrix-project-management) theory the app lets you prioritize and organize your life's tasks on a daily prioritized productivity sprints.

### Technology:

The app was build using the React.js framework using Javascript ECMAScript 2018 and the bootstrap framework.
For the front-end architecture I used the Flux framework and Context API to avoid website refresh at any moment, 
Offline mode: Event if the internet connection gets lost, you can keep building your todos without a problem.

### Features:

1. Add new task: You are forced to pick a priority #urgent vs #important. 
2. Gruped priotities: Using the hastag information the system arranges taks in 4 different groups of priorities: P1, P2, P3, P4.
3. Task completition: You can track completed vs uncompleted tasks, easly mark them as completed in one click.
4. Edit task: Updating a task name or priority is also possible.
